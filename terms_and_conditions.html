	<div class="text-section-header">Terms and Conditions</div>
	<div class="text-section-paragraph">
		The following General Terms and Conditions of purchase and sale apply to any transactions that take place between Hebe Kombucha and the purchaser of our products, unless otherwise agreed in writing.<br><br>

		By purchasing our products and/or awarding an order to purchase our products, the Purchaser acknowledges the following Terms and Conditions. Any differing General Terms and Conditions of sale provided by the Purchaser will only apply if they have been accepted by us in writing. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, neither these Terms and Conditions of Sale nor the transactions concluded under its assumption constitute a contract of distribution or any other continuing obligation. Hebe Kombucha reserves the right to change or supplement the General Terms and Conditions at any time.<br><br>

		Written quotations and pricing of our products are valid in accordance with the information provided on each individual document. Orders (taken via phone or placed online) are legally binding even though they have not been furnished with a signature. A statement from the Purchaser is only valid as an acceptance if it agrees unconditionally with our quotation and pricing. <br><br>

		Prices for our products and any additional expenses, i.e. shipping, are based upon the price lists valid at the time of order and does not include sales tax.<br><br>

		Due to the perishable nature of our products, delivery to Purchasers within the United States is within 48 hours upon receipt of order using conventional carrier services. All efforts will be done by Hebe Kombucha to assure maintenance of freshness of our products for the time of delivery. For other countries a special reaction time will apply. In the event of a delay in delivery or damage done to our products during delivery due to reasons outside the responsibility of Hebe Kombucha, the Purchaser does not have the right to cancel the delivery retroactively, nor to withdraw from the contract, nor to claim damages. Where the “use by” date for our products is concerned, the principle of “First In – First Out” will apply unless otherwise agreed in writing; in every delivery, the goods with the shortest “use by” date will be delivered.<br><br>

		Our products are perishable probiotics which contain less than 0.5% alcohol at the time of bottling. Due to the probiotic nature of our products, i.e. the presence of life organisms, the alcohol content may change over time especially if not stored properly following our recommendations. Therefore, to maintain the freshness and to protect the health beneficial components of our probiotics beverages, the consumers of our products are advised to keep our products refrigerated at all times.  Please enjoy our products fresh and consume within two weeks upon opening.<br><br>

		Our invoices must be paid pure net within 30 days from the date of the invoice, with no deductions. If the Purchaser does not adhere to the payment date, he/she will be in default without any period of notice, and we will be entitled to claim interest for late payment at the rate of 7%.<br><br>

		The Purchaser confirms receipt of the delivered goods with his signature on our dispatch documents. The Purchaser must check the condition and quantities of the delivered goods without delay. Any defects or missing deliveries must be notified to us in writing and in detail, immediately, or within 5 business days at the latest after the goods have been received (or after detection in case of hidden defects). In the event of a delay in notification, the delivery will be deemed to have been accepted and any warranty will cease.<br><br>

		The duty of warranty will apply until the “use by” date specified on our product. The term “defects” only applies to proven faults in the material or manufacture of the delivered goods.<br><br>
