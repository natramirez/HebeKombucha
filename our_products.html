				      <div class="modal-body" style="padding: 50px;">
				        <p><b><i><span class="keyword-text">Black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa)</span></i></b> is a small, deciduous shrub native to the colder regions of North America. It grows to about 5 to 8 feet tall and bears numerous small, black fruits with a diameter of about 1 cm. The fruits are slightly bitter in taste and are packed with free-radical-fighting compounds, scientifically called antioxidants. Science has shown that Aronia berries are super-rich in a class of antioxidants, called anthocyanins. Aronia has a long history of dietary use by humans. It was a staple in the diet of Native Americans for hundreds of years, who regularly used the Aronia berries to manage their daily health and well-being. In Europe, the Aronia berry has long been commercially used especially in the former Soviet Union. There, the plant was grown at a large scale since the late 1940s as a means for using it as a natural source of the antioxidant vitamin C. It has been grown as a commercial berry crop in Eastern European countries since the 1950s and in 2004 there were more than 11,119 acres in Poland. In Europe, Aronia gained tremendous attention as the next “antioxidant super fruit.” It is hailed by many as the "next Açai." As a result, Aronia businesses in Europe have started to increase from just two launches in 1997 to more than 100 in 2007. Fortunately for us here in the United Sates, since 2012 the Midwest Aronia Association started developing a network of growers and partners to promote the wider use of this remarkable fruit in the United States. </p>
				        <p>Chokeberries (Aronia) like most fruits are low in calories and fats. 100 g of fresh berries only contain around 50 calories. Aronia berries are extremely rich in the antioxidants anthocyanin, proanthocyanidins and vitamin C. 100 g of fresh berries provide about 35% of daily recommended levels of vitamin C. The total anthocyanin content is a sensational 1480 mg per 100 g of fresh berries, and the proanthocyanidin concentration is 664 mg per 100 g. With 16,062 micro-moles of Trolox Equivalents (TE) per 100 g, aronia berries show one of the highest ORAC values (a scientific measure for the antioxidant strength of food items) yet recorded among berries. The ORAC number of aronia berries is nearly three times the value of blueberries. The aronia fruit also contains high levels of folic acid, B vitamins, vitamin E, beta-carotene, minerals like potassium, iron and manganese, polyphenolic compounds, and dietary fiber. Most of those phytochemicals are found in the peel. Aronia fruits further contain a series of organic acids, including succinic acid, malic acid, quinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid and oxalic acid. In a recent scientific study, 27 polyphenolic compounds were identified in chokeberry, including 7 anthocyanins, 11 flavonols, 5 phenolic acids, 3 flavan-3- ols and 1 flavanone. Amongst those were cyanidin-3- galactoside, quercetin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, epicatechin, caffeic acid, pelargonidin and malvidin. All those polyphenolic flavonoids are known antioxidants with numerous proven or potential health benefits through scavenging dangerous oxygen-free radicals. </p>
				        <p>Scientific studies have shown that consumption of berries on a regular basis offers potential health benefits against cancer, aging and neurological diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and bacterial infections. Based on the existing and ongoing science, aronia berries have a huge potential to become the next great healthy food ingredient. Many researchers have looked at how consumption of aronia berries affects cardiovascular disease, esophageal, colon and breast cancers, liver failure and obesity and have come up with very exciting results. In a 2015 study, anthocyanin-rich phytochemicals found in aronia fruits were able to suppress visceral fat accumulation and hyperglycemia in rats by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity and/or intestinal lipid absorption. Research conducted with anthocyanins-rich extracts of aronia inhibited chemically induced esophageal and colon cancer in rats.</p>

				      </div>
				      <div class="modal-body" style="padding: 50px;">
				        <p>Figs are not only rich in natural sugars, potassium, iron and fiber, but boast high levels of polyphenols and other antioxidants with numerous health benefits. Figs also contain a proteolytic enzyme, called ficin, that may help with the digestion of food. The fig is actually not a fruit, but a petal-less flower that is inverted into itself. It is the plentiful seeds of the fig (or drupes how the biologists would say), which are the real fruit. So in a sense we added some “flower power” to our water kefir brew. Figs are the flower of the <b><i><span class="keyword-text">ficus tree (Ficus carica)</span></i></b>, which is a member of the mulberry family. Even though figs can be consumed either raw or dried, we at Hebe Kombucha use dried California black mission figs not only because of their great nutritional value, but more importantly due to their higher level of health supporting polyphenols and other powerful antioxidants. Modern science confirmed that figs are rich in polyphenols and show high antioxidant capabilities offering protection against oxidative damage of the human body, which has been linked to many major diseases, aging and cancer. Studies showed that properly dried figs are an even better source of phenolic compounds and express increased levels of antioxidant activity than their raw (fresh) counterparts. Figs have a longstanding reputation in traditional medicine and have been used to treat a wide range of common ailments for thousands of years. Figs were used a remedy for many health problems, including forms of cancer. More than 40 illnesses connected to the digestive, endocrine, reproductive, and respiratory systems have been treated with fig fruit, extracts, and components of the fig tree in different cultures throughout the world. Compounds in figs have been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal agents. In one study conducted at the Universiti Kebangsaan in Malaysia, fig extracts were able to suppress growth of oral bacteria, as well as various fungi and microbes. Even more interestingly, other scientific studies implicate that compounds in figs are able to boost some responses of the immune system.</p>
						<p>Figs are also a great source of the electrolyte potassium and of dietary fiber, two vital components to a healthy diet many people today do not get enough of. Dried figs provide up to 19 percent of your daily potassium intake. Fiber found in figs can aid the digestive system and reduce the risk of heart disease and colon cancer.</p>

				<div class="product-text">We have been crafting this great kombucha version for the longest time. This kombucha is not only packed with the goodness of 100% organic, locally grown apples, but also with the antioxidant power and rich flavor of California grown raisins. In order to offer the highest levels of health-supporting antioxidants, we only use the freshest, most seasonal apples available and (since most antioxidants reside in the apple peel), we only use unpeeled apples to prepare the fruit extracts for our kombucha. We all know the old Welsh proverb “an apple a day keeps the doctor away." To balance the acidity and slight tartness of the apples we use to make our kombucha, we infuse our kombucha with organic, California-made raisins.<!-- For those who never heard about Aronia, &lt;Click: Link11&gt; to learn more about this truly remarkable little “superfruit”. -->

				        <h4 class="modal-title">About Apples</h4>
				      </div>
				      <div class="modal-body" style="padding: 50px;">
				        <p>Apples, which are the fruits of the <b><i><span class="keyword-text">apple tree (Malus pumila)</span></i></b> and which originated in Central Asia, are the most cultivated and consumed of all fruits in the world. Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century and ever since cultivated. The first apple tree orchard was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625. Today most of the apples grown in the U.S. come from Washington State.</p>
						<p>There must be a good reason why people throughout the world have cherished this fruit since ancient times, why apples are continuously being praised as a “miracle food.” Well, apples are extremely rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, pectins, and dietary fibers, compounds which have been connected with the numerous health benefits attributed to this common, but remarkable fruit. Apples contain Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, B-complex vitamins (riboflavin, thiamin, and B3, B6), carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin), dietary fiber, and polyphenols (flavonoids). Besides offering important minerals, such as calcium, potassium and iron, apples also contain almost no fat, sodium or cholesterol, all known risk factors for heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>
						<p>The health benefits of apples are too numerous to list them here. For example, consumption of apples may protect brain function. According to a 2006 study published in the journal <i>Experimental Biology and Medicine</i>, quercetin (one of the antioxidant flavonoids found abundantly in apples) reduced the cellular death of neurons caused by oxidation and inflammation. Regular consumption of apples also can prevent thrombosis and stroke. A scientific study including 9,208 men and women revealed that those who ate the most apples over a 28-year period had the lowest risk for stroke. The researchers concluded that the intake of apples is related to a decreased risk of thrombotic stroke. Furthermore, consumption of apples can lower your cholesterol level. A group of scientists at Florida State University found that older women who ate apples everyday had 23% less bad cholesterol (LDL) and 4% more good cholesterol (HDL) after just six months. Regular consumption of apples may even ward off certain forms of cancer, which has been linked to the phenolics found in apples. Finally, eating apples may even help to prevent obesity. A study published in the journal <i>Food Chemistry</i> in 2014, analyzed the effect of different varieties of apples - Granny Smith, Braeburn, Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, McIntosh and Red Delicious – on the population of “good” bacteria in the gut of diet-induced obese mice. The findings of the researchers suggest that apples have properties able to prevent obesity and its associated disorders.</p>

				      </div>
				      <div class="modal-body" style="padding: 50px;">
				        <p>Raisins are the dried fruits of the <b><i><span class="keyword-text">grape vine (Vinifera sp.)</span></i></b>, a plant agricultured by mankind since ancient times. Like grapes, raisins are a rich source of nutrients, fibers, vitamins, polyphenolics, flavonoids, electrolytes, most namely potassium, and minerals, however, in a much more concentrated form. Raisins are a rich source of antioxidants which are very likely responsible for the many health benefits associated with the consumption of this "power food." The total measured antioxidant strength (ORAC value) of raisins is with about 3,037 μmol Trolox equivalents higher than grapes. As in grapes, raisins contain resveratrol, a polyphenol and strong antioxidant credited with numerous health benefits, from anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, reducing the risk of strokes, cholesterol lowering all the way to anti-cancer. Scientific studies further suggest that resveratrol may have protective action against certain types of cancer like melanoma, colon and prostate. Furthermore, raisins derived from red or purple grapes are also very rich in anthocyanins, a reddish colored antioxidant polyphenol. Anthocyanins have been found to have immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities. Raisins are also abundant in flavonoid compounds, such as catechins, and tannins. Lastly, raisins are dense sources of minerals like calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium copper, fluoride, and zinc. Copper and manganese are essential co-factors of <i>superoxide dismutase</i>, an antioxidant enzyme important for removal of oxygen free radicals and cell protection.</p>
