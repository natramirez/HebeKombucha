		What even are probiotics? What are their health benefits? Since we want to make sure that our customers not only enjoy our products, but also understand and like our probiotics as much as we do here at HebeKombucha, let’s get some of those questions answered. Let’s begin with the name itself. Probiotic derives from Latin, meaning 'for life'. As the name implies probiotics are foods containing tiny life forms (“bios”) offering certain health benefits (“Pro”) for other forms of life, aka, us humans. Looking back in time and at different cultures around the world, probiotics have been around and consumed by humans for a very long time. Humans have been eating and drinking probiotics foods, such as beer, cider, wine, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, kwass, kombucha, tepache, kumis and cheese (to name just some of the more prominent ones), long before modern science helped us to become aware of the existence of microorganisms found in those fermented foods. According to ancient legends, yoghurt (another probiotic food) most likely resulted from the (unintentional) fermentation happening within animal skin bags which were used for transportation of water and milk in regions of Middle Asia and the Middle East. So the history of probiotics, especially kefir, is very intertwined with human evolution and can be traced back to the ancient times, nearly 10,000 years ago.</p>
		 <p>We can all agree today that long before the invention of the refrigerator in the 19th century, humans have been (unknowingly) living on probiotics diets all around the world. People relied on and cherished fermented food, e.g. kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir, kwass, pulke, tepache (to name some prominent ones) around the world for thousands of years; long before the modern term “probiotics” was coined. But this all changed and was pushed aside with the onset and rise of the industrialized and mass produced modern western diet in the 1950s, then touted as the new, better and safer way of modern life. The new, western diet was now heavily based on processed, filtered, purified, and heavily engineered food concoctions.</p>
        <p>
		Thanks to modern science we now begin to realize that this chosen path in human diet may not have served mankind well … and least not from a general public health point of view. There is now mounting scientific evidence that probiotics, such as yogurt, kefir, and kombucha, can be effective dietary products that help to decrease the risk of many human diseases, ranging from metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, all the way to cancer. Some scientists go even one step further, claiming that the continued replacement of fermented foods by increasingly processed food over the last fifty years or so may have set the stage for the rise of many “modern diseases," such as food allergies and autoimmune diseases. Science increasingly supports the notion that it is the microbes or some of the microbial products in the probiotics which elicit a multitude of beneficial effects on the human body’s different systems.</p>
		<p>
		For example, kefir, a unique cultured product, contains probiotics which exhibit numerous beneficial qualities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, and anti-cancer effects. Nevertheless, kefir cultures from different parts of the world exert different effects because of variation in culture conditions and media. According to a <!-- <span class="keyword-text" title="Zamberi NR, Abu N, et al. The Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenesis Effects of Kefir Water on Murine Breast Cancer Cells. Integr Cancer Ther. 2016 Dec;15(4): 53-56" > -->scientific study conducted in Malaysia, water kefir shows antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects on breast cancer cells, pointing to the potential of the probiotic beverage kefir in cancer treatment. Other studies with kefir strongly indicate that regular consumption of this probiotic beverage may reduce insulin resistance and help to lower blood plasma and liver triglyceride (fat) levels. Many scientific studies further indicate that probiotics, when used on a regular basis in our diet, may help to maintain a favorable gut microbiome. In other words, regular consumption of probiotics may help to stabilize the normal population of “good bacteria” and to keep a healthy and intact protective layer in our digestive system.</p>
		<p> Another exciting study 
		<!-- <Link 03> Spinler JK, Ross CL, Savidge TC. Probiotics as adjunctive therapy for preventing Clostridium difficile infection - What are we waiting for? Anaerobe. 2016 Oct;41:51-57. -->
		indicates that natural antibiotics produced and released by probiotic bacteria may help to inhibit the takeover by known intestinal and very common “food pathogens”, such as C. difficile, Salmonella or Listeria. Clostridium difficile, is now the single leading cause of hospital-acquired bacterial infections and by far the most deadly enteric pathogen in the U.S. Some scientists conclude that the benefits offered by a probiotics diet may become ever more important at the end of an era many microbiologists called the “golden era of antibiotic discovery”. </p>
		<p>Yet according to another interesting scientific study 
		<!-- Mulak A, Bonaz B. Brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease. World J Gastroenterol. 2015 Oct 7;21(37):10609-20. -->
		the normal gut microbiota may even have a reach into the brain, conferring protection against certain neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and its associated gastrointestinal manifestations may trigger a pathological process that eventually spreads from the gut to the brain. According to some scientists, gut problems (dysbiosis) caused by overgrowth of “bad bacteria” in the small intestine and increased intestinal permeability may induce systemic inflammation and initiate damage (mis-folding) of the PD protein alpha-synuclein. So, looking at the greater picture, probiotics may become an ever more important nutritional solution and an affordable path forward towards disease prevention at a time characterized by the emergence of many antibiotic-resistant microbes and many neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>
		Let’s talk a bit about kombucha (pronounced: “Kom-BOO-tscha”), a special probiotics beverage we craft here at Hebe. Kombucha, is an ancient probiotics beverage which has been studied for more than 80 years now. It has been credited with numerous health benefits. A series of scientific studies strongly point to kombucha being remarkably effective in reducing hepato-toxicity induced by environmental toxins. A comparative study conducted on black tea, kombucha tea and enzyme-processed black tea has proven the efficacy of kombucha tea and attributed the liver protecting effects to its antioxidant power. According to some reports it seems to help restoring the levels of glutathione, the human body’s master antioxidant and major component necessary for detoxification. Kombucha is also known to have relatively high levels of glucuronic acid, a compound used by the liver to remove all types of toxins (xenobiotics). Numerous scientific studies exist – some going back more than 50 years – further suggesting that the probiotic kombucha has immune-stimulatory and anti-cancer properties. Compounds in kombucha, most namely glucaric acid, has been reported to be effective in preventing various types of cancer including pancreatic and breast cancer. In Asian cultures, kombucha has a long traditional use as a natural therapeutic agent helping to control the factors implicated in diabetic conditions.</p>
		<p>
		Even though kombucha has been around for more than a thousand years, most people still have never heard about it. Well, kombucha tea (or simply kombucha) is, like beer, cider, or wine: a fermented beverage. But compared to beer, cider, or wine, kombucha (and water kefir for that matter) contains almost no alcohol and – kombucha is a truly probiotic beverage. Probiotic means that the final kombucha product contains millions of live microorganisms and derived microorganismal byproducts, most namely vitamins and organic acids, offering a myriad of “probiotic” health benefits. While most beer breweries filter out the biotic component, i.e. the yeast, from their final product, we leave a significant amount of our vitamin-rich, health beneficial probiotic “living” components in our final products.</p>
		<p>
		There is another big difference of kombucha to beer, wine and other fermented beverages. Because kombucha is made by fermenting natural tea leaves, which are naturally rich in caffeine, kombucha is a naturally caffeinated and slightly carbonated energizing drink. This is very different to the currently very fashionable energy drinks which are to the most extent composed using synthetic vitamins and energy boosting compounds, i.e. caffeine and taurine. 
		Putting it all together now, because of its remarkable complexity and complex composition, kombucha is the “queen of all fermented beverages”. It is an all natural, refreshing and energizing probiotic containing only traces of natural, tea-derived caffeine and invigorating organic acids. Compared with many other fermented beverages and fashionable energy drinks, kombucha offers it all: it is a health-enhancing probiotic, as well as a refreshing, gently energizing drink. And it does it all naturally!
		</p>
		<h3 class="keyword-text">How is kombucha made?</h3>
		<p>
		Well, kombucha is like beer, apple cider or wine a fermented beverage. It is produced with the help of microorganisms through an all biological process called fermentation. In a sense, kombucha is “brewed”. But kombucha is made using not only yeast (as in the case of beer and wine) or bacteria (as in the case of vinegar or yoghurt): Kombucha is made using bacteria AND yeast. In kombucha, both type of microorganisms work together in a remarkable consortium of microorganisms, commonly called mother or symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast  - simply called SCOBY by the kombucha brew masters. Also, instead of using a high maltose sugar broth (as in the case of beer) or the fructose sugar-rich juice of grapes or apples (as in the case of wine or cider), kombucha is brewed by fermenting black or green tea in the presence of pure cane sugar. Kombucha tea is made by adding the SCOBY to the cane sugar-sweetened black or green tea, and allowing the mix to ferment for 10-20 days. Over time this microbial consortium consisting of yeasts and bacteria, like a miniature “biochemical disassembly belt”, converts the cane sugar in the tea into several metabolic end products, many of which with evident or purported health benefits. 
		</p>
		<p>
		After the fermentation period, the now slightly fizzy and sour kombucha product will be bottled or kegged and chilled. The natural flavor of kombucha tastes somewhere in the middle of apple cider and champagne, depending on the choice of tea (black or green) and the fermentation conditions. It is now ready for your enjoyment. Today, many makers of kombucha (especially here in the U.S.) are adding additional flavors to the final fermentation product. Flavors are added usually in the form of fruit juices or fruit extracts with the intention to enrich the natural kombucha flavor and to add additional benefits to the amazing medicinal qualities of this remarkable beverage.

		<h3 class="keyword-text">What exactly is in kombucha?</h3>
		<p>
		People without a deeper understanding of biology often (and wrongly) refer to kombucha as “mushroom tea”. However, as anyone who was sitting in a microbiology class learning about microorganisms can tell you, kombucha is far from being a “mushroom”. According to the latest science (and quite some work has been done on kombucha’s microbiology), the SCOBY used to make kombucha is made by using a fascinating symbiosis of single-celled fungi, called yeast, and several species of probiotic bacteria. The kombucha yeasts includes one or more of <i>Candida species</i>, e.g. <i>C. stellate</i> (not to be mixed up with the disease-causing yeast <i>Candida albicans</i>!), <i>Zygosaccharomyces sp.</i> (<i>baili/rouxii</i>), <i>Brettanomyces bruxellensis</i> (the same yeast used to make sour beers, e.g. Lambic), <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (the same as in brewing beer), <i>Torulaspora delbrueckii</i>, and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. The bacterial component of the SCOBY is dominated by three bacterial genera which are <i>Komagataeibacter xylinum</i> (former <i>Gluconacetobacter xylinum</i>), <i>Acetobacter sp.</i>, and <i>Gluconobacter sp.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		The tangy, slightly fizzing liquid resulting from the fermentation of tea contains a plethora of chemical compounds. Many of which with known or suspected health benefits. Besides being rich in organic acids, such as acetic acid (think of vinegar!) and lactic acid (think of yogurt), glucuronic acid, gluconic acid and succinic acid, it also contains B vitamins and a number of antioxidants. Depending on the fermentation process, kombucha only contains between 0.5 and 2% alcohol. But most commercial kombucha drinks in the United States have less than 0.5% alcohol, due to the mixing in of fruit extracts and flavors.
		</p>
		<p>
		Considering the variety of symbiotic yeast and bacterial species found in the SCOBY, it is not too surprising that kombucha can be labelled as one of the most complex and chemically diverse commercial fermentation product on earth. Compared with kombucha, fermentation products such as beer, wine, yoghurt or Sauerkraut, only contain a “handful” of fermentation end products, most namely ethanol and lactic acid. In contrast, many more compounds have been identified in kombucha, most of them with known or potential health benefits, including polyphenols (catechins), 4-ethylphenol, phenethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, amino acids and a variety of organic acids, including acetic acid, 5-keto-gluconic acid (5KGA), lactic acid, butyric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, usnic acid, hyaluronic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, decanoic acid (capric acid), and hexanoic acid (caproic acid). Most of the metabolites identified are organic acids, most namely acetic acid, glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, glucaric acid and the antibacterial properties possessing usnic acid. Yes, there are indeed a lot of different organic acids in kombucha which is to the most extent responsible for the low pH and acidic taste of this fermented beverage. But this is not all. Besides the many organic acids and traces of ethanol, kombucha also contains a range of vitamins such as vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B6, B9 (folic acid), B12 (cobalamin), vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and other antioxidants. The 20 amino acids known to science are the molecular building blocks of all proteins. Of the 20 amino acids nine are considered to be essential because they cannot be made by the human body. We have to take them up via our food. Kombucha contains all nine of the essential amino acids, i.e. histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Of the amino acids found in kombucha, lysine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, alanine, aspartic acid and proline have the highest concentrations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Kombucha also contains many enzymes, many of those important for digestion and detoxification. Enzymes are nature’s catalysts with which cells accelerate chemical reactions and break down materials. The following enzymes have been found in kombucha: amylase, carbohydrase, catalase, hexokinases, invertases, lipases, proteases, sucrases and phytases. Since kombucha is made from tea, it also contains traces of caffeine, tannins and (especially in the case of kombucha made from green tea) the anti-cancer compound epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Lastly, since kombucha is made with the help of unique bacterial species, most namely <i>Glucoacetobacter</i>, it also contains special types of powerful, natural antibiotics called bactericins. Consequently, kombucha possesses bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic properties, effective against a range of serious human pathogens, including <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Staphylococci</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i> species.

	<div class="text-section-paragraph">
	<p>
		Water kefir is – like its much better known name cousin milk kefir – a probiotic beverage. It is a slightly fizzy, little sour and tangy beverage. As any other probiotic, water kefir contains live and active probiotic microbial cultures offering many health benefits, including helping to support immunity and a healthy digestion. However, compared with traditional kefir, water kefir is not made from milk but from natural organic cane sugar, usually fermented in the presence of additional nutrients derived from organically grown fruits and/or herbs. Therefore, water kefir is a lactose-free probiotic beverage rich in minerals, vitamins and antioxidants. </p>
		<p>
		Similar in nature as kombucha, water kefir cultures – often referred to as “Japanese water crystals” - consist of a complex symbiotic microbial community embedded into a natural, bacteria-made polysaccharide matrix. Depending on the culture conditions, water kefir grains are comprised of a highly variable community of lactic acid and acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts. According to two scientific studies: Laureys D. & De Vuyst L, J Appl Microbiol. 2016 Dec. 8 and Gulitz A, Stadie J, Wenning M, Ehrmann MA, Vogel RF. Int J Food Microbiol. 2011 Dec 15;151(3): 284-288), the majority of microorganisms present in water kefir grains are:</p>

		<ul><b>Bacteria:</b>
		<li>Lactobacillus hordei</li>
		<li>Lactobacillus paracasei</li>
		<li>Lactobacillus nagelii</li>
		<li>Lactobacillus hilgardii</li>
		<li>Bifidobacterium aquikefiri</li>
		<li>Leuconostoc mesenteroides/citreum</li>
		<li>Acetobacter fabarum</li>
		</ul>
		<ul><b>Yeasts:</b>
		<li>Saccharomyces cerevisiae (“brewer’s yeast”)</li>
		<li>Zygotorulospora Florentina</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		According to a 2008 study (Rouse S, Canchaya C, van Sinderen D. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2008 Sep;58: 2013-17), Lactobacillus hordei produces natural antibiotics, called bactericins, which may explain some of the health benefits of water kefir. During the natural fermentation process, the water kefir cultures ferment almost all of the sugar provided to them and convert it into organic acids and carbon dioxide. Consequently, water kefir is a naturally carbonated, very refreshing low sugar beverage, suitable for individuals with metabolic syndrome. In addition the fermentation process generates additional vitamins, minerals and enzymes adding to the health benefits of this beverage. Even though our water kefir cultures contain less probiotic power than traditional milk kefir, the fruits and herbs commonly included during our fermentation process add additional health benefits in the form of minerals, antioxidants, polyphenols and fibers to the water kefir product. Due to the selected all organic fruits and our unique fruit juice preparation process, the water kefir we create here at HebeKombucha is not only a great probiotic. It is a great tasting, energizing beverage functionally enriched with health benefits adding fruit and herb preparations. </p>
